## Introduction
This is a mini project for the course SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
## Contents
* Backups
    * Contains various backups of the project.
* individual sandboxes
    * Contains various files for each of us to experiment with various code before we merge it into the main project file.
* colab.ipynb
    * The main project file.
* Levels_Fyi_Salary_Data.csv
    * The data file.
* readme.md
    * The readme file.
## Purpose and Problem
There are many jobs that require the skill of computer engineering and computer science. However, it comes to the point where we were considering whether is it worth spending more years to further the education or more experience in the working world?
## Models Used
* 1. Linear Regression
* 2. XGBoost 
## Conclusion 
* Bachelors (with 2 years of experience) vs Masters (fresh grad), generally the individual with the Bachelors and 2 years of experience would yield a better total yearly compensation as compared to a fresh grad Masters student 
* Bachelors (with 6 years of experience) vs PHD (fresh grad), generally the individual with the Bachelors and 6 years of experience would yield slightly better total yearly compensation as compred to a fresh grad PHD student. However, this is inconclusive since our dataset does not have a big enough sample size of individuals with PHD. 
* When we did the one to one comparision of the different education (PHD, Masters and Bachelors), the IQR and median of the individuals with Masters and Bachelors are very similar, while the PHD holder have a better starting point. 
* Years of experience would be more worth as compared to furthering your education
